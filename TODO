- node-cron to fetch information regularly (slower if laser cutter is up?)
- Add useful links
- When down, show form
  X Allow form submission, store email in mongodb
  X On fetch if status changes email users and clear DB
  - Maybe avoid spam attacks somehow? Login/confirmation mechanism?
X When up & in use, show message
  - Allow "Notify me when done"
  - Use chrome notifications
  - Maybe serviceworker.js?
  - Maybe chrome push notifications?
- When unknown, link to tools page
- Auto run TSC on npm install
- "Unknown" status
- "When's it going to be back up?" page with random date in the far future ("We asked a wise man and he said...")
