- node-cron to fetch information regularly (slower if laser cutter is up?)
- store last state in mongo or FS
- On page load, display last state (fetch if too old)
- When down, show form
  - Allow form submission, store email in mongodb
  - On fetch if status changes email users and clear DB
  - Maybe avoid spam attacks somehow? Login/confirmation mechanism?
- When up & in use, show message
  - Allow "Notify me when done"
  - Use chrome notifications
  - Maybe serviceworker.js?
  - Maybe chrome push notifications?
